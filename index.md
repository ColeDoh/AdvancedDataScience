### What is Paste Special
Within Excel copy and paste is a very helpful tool. Everybody knows ctrl+c is copy and ctrl+v is paste. Paste special allows the user to choose specific elements of a copied cell and perform mathematical operations with the copied data. Essentially if you have a spreadsheet of data with different formulas and you want to copy and paste those values to another part of the spreadsheet it will be incorrect. Paste Special allows for you to do this with no problems.

### Why is Paste Special useful
When you have formulas within a spreadsheet, often times those values will have to be copied and put into another spot on the spreadsheet or an entirely different spreadsheet.  Paste special is magical when it comes to this.  When you copy and paste values from a cell there is typically a formula associated with calculating that value. When you go to paste the values in another cell, they turn to the number 0. This is because these cells are looking at the wrong spots within the spreadsheet. The cells right next to where you copy and paste from dont have a formula associated with it. Paste special allows you to customize how you want to copy and paste. Anoither reason why people use paste special is for time management and efficiency. The transpose tool within paste special is also very helpful because it puts data horizontally instead of vertically. This provides a different way to present the data.
### Step 1:
The very first step is to copy multiple cells from your data set with ctrl-c. Next you should navigate to the home tab on the ribbon and locate Paste icon and click the small arrow. The path is as follows ctrl c-> Home-> arrow -> Paste Special

### Step 2:
Once you click "Paste Special" this window will pop up with all of your options.

### Step 3:
For this example I will select "values". Now once I hit "ok" the window will exit back to the spreadsheet.

Now you do ctrl-v to paste into an empty cell. Now all of the values from the average column are now in a different column.

### Another function of Paste Special
Another fantastic use of Paste Special is the transpose function. Instead of having all of your results vertical, you can put them horizantally. This could potentially help with spacing issues you may have. For this example I used a dataset that tracked the most common dog names over a two year span. This data set had a lot more data so I wanted to transpose it horizontally instead of vertically.

### Step 1:
Now that you have made it this far in the tutorial I will be showing you another function of Paste Special. First you must create another workbook. File-> New and then click a blank workbook. This dataset tracks the most common dog name over a two year span. For the first step you must copy a group of data (ctrl-c).

Now I have selcted the column I want.

### Step 2:
The next step is the same as before (ctrl-c-> Home-> arrow -> Paste Special) but instead you tick the box labled "transpose".

Now you press "ok and the window closes.

### Step 3:
The last step is to hit ctrl-v into an open cell. The data will now appear horizontally instead of vertically.
